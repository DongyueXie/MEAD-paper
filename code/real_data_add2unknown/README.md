This folder contains functions to re-produce the results in the real data analysis. We no longer merge the two U neuron cells in this analysis. 


The generate_ref_p.R script pre-generates necessary analysis parameters and save them in desired folder.
The read_data_func.R script contains all the functions to perform the analysis. The function reads in the analysis parameters generated above.
To get the analysis results, run real_data_run.R script.

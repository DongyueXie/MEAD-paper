The R code CIBERSORT.R was obtained from https://cibersort.stanford.edu/, and is included only for paper review purpose, not for distribution.

The real_data folder contains code to run the Neuron numerical example. 

The cross_platform folder contains code to run the cross-platform deconvolution example. 

The simulation and simulation_softplus folder have code to run the synthetic simulation examples.
